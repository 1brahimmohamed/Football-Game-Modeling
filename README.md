# Football-Game-Modeling

### Breif description of the project
Soccer game direct foul kick scenario of Problems in Sports Engineering Course Sheet. Drag forces are neglected,
and we are assume that the shooting spots are as much as possible perpendicular to the goal line (no side kicks).

It's a simple program game to simulate this scenario with a graphical user interface displaying the following parameters:
- **Control knobs**:
  - Distance from the goal
  - Firing angle
  - Firing velocity
- **Indicators**:
  - Maximum ball height
  - Ball height at the goal plane arrival point

### How to run the program
- Clone the repository
- install the requirements:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Run the following command in the terminal:
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```
- Enjoy the game!
